"""
Binary search trees are a data structure that enforce an ordering over 
the data they store. That ordering in turn makes it a lot more efficient 
at searching for a particular piece of data in the tree. 

This part of the project comprises two days:
1. Implement the methods `insert`, `contains`, `get_max`, and `for_each`
   on the BSTNode class.
2. Implement the `in_order_print`, `bft_print`, and `dft_print` methods
   on the BSTNode class.
